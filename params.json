{"name":"MAVRIC Robotics Platform","tagline":"Senior Project from Thinh Le, Keith Lueneburg, Drew May, and Brandon Thomas","body":"### Welcome to the hub for MAVRIC\r\nMAVRIC stands for Mobile Autonomous Vehicle for Research in Intelligent Control. MAVRIC uses a TI Tiva microcontroller in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi to gather sensory data and process it through the use of adaptrode based neurons. A term coined by University of Washington Tacoma professor George Mobus.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAdaptrode: A mechanism that encodes auto and cross-correlated signals across multiple time scales.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, MAVRIC processes data such as hunger, sight, and sounds the same way animals in nature do, through the use neural networks.\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement\r\nThe Institute of Technology has an outdated mobile robot platform that is capable of some simple autonomous movement and simulated animal behavior. How robust the behavior that the platform can achieve is dependent on the software and hardware within this platform. Thus, this is the main problem with this platform, in that the hardware on board is not powerful enough to run very sophisticated software to interface with sensors and peripherals. However now, there are sophisticated and cost effective resources available to upgrade the logic hardware within this platform and thereby enhance the potential of software development. Dr. Mobus requires a more capable platform in order to test learning capabilities in machines. Such a device would allow greater software options and thusly the research could continue.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n![The MAVRIC Logic Board](http://i.imgur.com/RPYqVdu.jpg)\r\n![Grabby McGrabberson](http://i.imgur.com/FFePWXV.jpg)\r\n![Prototyping wheels](http://i.imgur.com/yR8DEJO.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMAVRIC was created by Thinh Le (@thinhle-UWT2015), Keith Lueneburg (@keithlueneburg), Drew May (@drewm135), and Brandon Thomas (@brandondeanthomas).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to know more about MAVRIC?
